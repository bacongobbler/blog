Hi, I'm Matt! =3

I'm a Canadian Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure working on open source developer tools. I'm a core maintainer on several open source projects including [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), [Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft) and [Brigade](https://github.com/Azure/brigade).

I created this blog to write HOWTOs for software development, as well as my general thoughts on the state of software engineering. This includes (but is not limited to): linux, containers, Kubernetes, Go, and Azure.

I love metalwork, automechanics, game development and camping. When I'm not at work, you can usually find me in the garage working on some japanese import car from the '90s or blacksmithing.

[Here you can find the best way to get in touch with me.](/contact/)
