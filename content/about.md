I'm a Canadian Software Engineer working on open source developer tools. I'm a core maintainer on several open source projects over on [GitHub](https://github.com/bacongobbler).

I created this blog to write HOWTOs or tutorials for projects I'm working on, as well as my general thoughts on the state software engineering.
