Some hilarious one-liners from deis-bot, a buildbot that sits in #deis on IRC:

    <gabrtv> deis-bot: if you bitch about db schema changes you're gonna make me upset
    <deis-bot> gabrtv: if you need to reprovision your controllers
    <gabrtv> that's a good point, but i tested it and the schema migration is backwards compatible w/ my existing controller

    <deis-bot> build #261 of deis is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.opdemand.com:8010/builders/deis/builds/261
    <gabrtv> that's a good deis-bot
    <deis-bot> gabrtv: that's a lot of work
